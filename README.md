# ATM : access-the-marks
> by Sai Sudhir S


This is a program to get the result of a specific student using their roll number.

It can be used to access data of a large number of students and calculate their result without turning multiple pages or scrolling through hundreds of cells.


------

### Input Data (to be added before running the program)

- All the data is stored in a text file(with extenion as .txt).

- A sample file is present in the repository with name "sample_data.txt".

- Use the same format while creating new text documents. 

- The location of the text document should be updated in the code, where main function is defined(line 80 *subject to change) 

------

### Etymology

Just like how a bank ATM gives access cash and account details, the ATM (Access The Marks) gives access to student marks and other stats.

------

## Features under development

* The marks can be plotted in a graph

* marks of multiple students can be compared

* grades can be automatically assigned
